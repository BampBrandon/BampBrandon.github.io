## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1
This was my favorite lab because it was a great introduction to programming. It showed me just how much I have grown in my coding skills, such as cloning a repository, making changes, adding an Authors.md file, and pushing them to GitHub. What once seemed complicated is now something I can do easily. It has been an amazing journey.

Lab 4
This was my second favorite lab because it was when I started developing a real passion for programming. I found it interesting to convert volume measurements between different units, and seeing all the work come together left me astonished. I enjoyed breaking down the problem into smaller functions like MlToTsp, MlToTbsp, MlToOunces, and MlToCup, it made the code more organized and easier to understand.

Lab 7
This was my third favorite lab because it provided a real-world scenario that intrigued me, as it was the first time I saw programming in a more practical sense. It was quite challenging implementing parking regulations for different streets, as it required careful consideration of multiple conditions and the use of conditional statements. Although it was difficult, I found it enjoyable in the end.
