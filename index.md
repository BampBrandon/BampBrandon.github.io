## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

 This was my favorite lab because it was a great introduction to programming. It helped me build a solid foundation in coding and gave me the confidence to continue learning. The lab showed me just how much I have grown in my coding skills, such as cloning a repository, making changes, adding an Authors.md file, and pushing them to GitHub. What once seemed complicated is now something I can do easily. I never imagined I would become so comfortable with GitHub and version control so quickly. This experience was not only educational but also empowering, and it has been an amazing journey.

* Lab 4

 This was my second favorite lab because it was when I started developing a real passion for programming. The project involved converting volume measurements between different units, and I found it incredibly interesting. It was satisfying to see all the work come together, and it left me astonished by how efficient the program could be. I enjoyed breaking down the problem into smaller functions like MlToTsp, MlToTbsp, MlToOunces, and MlToCup. Each function was simple on its own, but together they made the code much more organized and easier to understand. This lab helped me appreciate the power of modular programming and how it can make complex tasks more manageable.

* Lab 7

 This was my third favorite lab because it provided a real-world scenario that intrigued me, as it was the first time I saw programming in a more practical sense. The task involved implementing parking regulations for different streets, which required not only coding but also critical thinking and problem-solving. It was quite challenging because it involved multiple conditions. Although it was difficult at times, the challenge made it all the more rewarding. In the end, I found the experience enjoyable, and it sparked my interest futher.
